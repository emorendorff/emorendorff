#### Em Orendorff

Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer currently working at [Vanilla](https://www.justvanilla.com/) on tools that help people navigate the complexity of estate planning. In a different life, I was a manager, educator and competitor in the world of specialty coffee.

At work, I'm interested in creating reusable design systems, picking up Ruby as I go, and optimizing typescript while trying to make my coworkers laugh a little (it works sometimes).

Outside of work, catch me at the local estate sales and antique malls of Richmond, VA, running along the James River, throwing a stick for my dog Moose, or fixing up our old home.
