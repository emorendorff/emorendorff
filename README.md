#### Em Orendorff

Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer currently working at [Vanilla](https://www.justvanilla.com/) on tools that help people navigate the complexity of estate planning. In a different life, I was a manager, educator and competitor in the world of specialty coffee and could once claim to be the 6th best barista in the country.

At work, I'm interested in creating reusable design systems, picking up Ruby as I go, and optimizing typescript while trying to make my coworkers laugh a little (it works sometimes).

Outside of work, catch me at the local estate sales and antique malls, running along the river, throwing a stick for my dog Moose, or fixing up my old home.
